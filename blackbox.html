                <h4>6061 ALUMINUM HOUSING</h4>
                <p>The protective housing was fully designed by me, consisting of two parts — the lid and the body — made of 6061 Aluminum for its ideal balance of strength, weight, and machinability.</p>
                <p>The interface between body and the lid are precision-toleranced to be a watertight snap fit. The bottom of the body include reinforcement ribs to prevent buckling. The depth and contours of the body pockets are designed to be manufacturable taking into account the available endmills we have.</p>
                <p>After finalizing the CAD and CAM, the parts were machined by Cameron Galibois on the Tormach CNC mill.</p>

                <h4>STRENGTH ANALYSIS</h4>
                <p>Before we could manufacture the housing, the design first had to be verified. The loading case was based on the worst-case scenario: the blackbox impacting the ground head-on at Mach 1.7 (our rocket’s max velocity) — an extremely unlikely event, but a useful upper bound. This load was calculated to be roughly 960 kPa, which was rounded up to 1 MPa.</p>
                <p>An FEA simulation was then performed on ANSYS, applying this load separately to each of the three primary faces, with fixed constraints on the opposite face. The lowest safety factor recorded was 1.62, which passes our design requirement of a minimum FoS of 1.5.</p>

                <h4>SHOCK SUSPENSION SYSTEM</h4>
                <p>To mitigate the transmission of shock to the main PCB within the blackbox, the board is not mounted directly to the housing. Instead, it is suspended using a dual-spring isolation system. This configuration ensures that impact forces from collisions are not directly imparted to the PCB, but are instead gradually dissipated through controlled oscillations of the suspension mechanism.</p>

                <h4>SUPERCAPACITORS</h4>
                <p>The black box is powered by an external 3.7V Li-Ion battery located within the avionics bay. However, reliance on external power introduces the risk of data loss in the event of a rapid unscheduled disassembly (RUD). Therefore, a simple and reliable internal backup power system is required.</p>

                <p><b>Our solution? Supercapacitors.</b></p>

                <p> Two 5V, 2.5F supercapacitors are chosen and configured to be quick-charged from primary power in less than 30 seconds of powering on, using a dedicated constant current charging circuit. In the event of primary power failure, a diode ORing configuration ensures automatic switchover to the backup supercapacitors. The supercapacitors store sufficient energy to power the system for approximately 30 seconds — enough time to flush telemetry data to non-volatile flash memory.</p>

                <p>An additional flash chip was soldered on to provide an extra 1GB of storage capabilities. This is plenty sufficient for flight telemetry purposes.</p>

                <h4>MARCO POLO RADIO TRACKER</h4>
                <p>To ensure post-flight recoverability in the event of a rapid unscheduled disassembly (RUD) or signal loss, a standalone radio beacon is integrated into the blackbox. We selected the Marco Polo tracking system due to its self-contained operation, long-range directional tracking, and proven reliability in unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Unlike GPS-based trackers, it does not rely on cellular or satellite infrastructure, making it ideal for remote recovery scenarios.</p>

                    The IREC 2025 launch was the culmination of our effort. The motor burn was nominal and the rocket demonstrated good off-the-rail stability. However, a structural event as the rocket approached max q led to loss of the fins and causing overall vehicle breakup. The motor kept burning and landed ballistically. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite this, we recovered all components, where the Marco Polo tracker proved incredibly helpful in locating the avionics bay in the middle of the desert. Overall the team is incredibly proud of the work that went into this vehicle - from design to launch.
