                <p>High-powered rockets experience extreme forces during launch, accelerating to nearly Mach 2 in less
                    than 10 seconds. With the amount of aerodynamic force in play, any small misalignments in the
                    construction of the rocket can quickly compound into large, uncontrolled movements. In particular,
                    roll - rotation about the rocket’s longitudinal axis - is notoriously annoying and hard to control.

                <p>One of our missions with each launch at Duke AERO - Duke University’s collegiate rocketry
                    organization - is to capture beautiful, high-quality flight footage from a camera mounted on the
                    rocket body. However, uncontrolled roll can turn that footage into a dizzying blur. Worse, excessive
                    roll can tangle parachute chords if the rocket is still spinning rapidly at chute deployment.</p>

                <p>To address this, our team developed an active roll control system using canards - small, actuated

                    counteract roll in real time, allowing for better footage and more stable flights.</p>

                IREC rocket. <br>I was tasked with conducting preliminary research into reaction-wheel alternatives,

            <div class="row">
                <div class="p-col">
                    <p>The first challenge in designing a roll-control system was choosing between a reaction wheel or
                        canards system.</p>
                    <p>On paper, the elegance of a reaction-wheel system was compelling — no external moving parts, no
                        messy aerodynamic downstream, ultra-precise control. To test its viability, I built a simplified
                        analytical model of the rocket, treating it as a near-hoop structure to capture its moment of
                        inertia. The numbers told a clear story: counteracting a 3 Hz roll rate within half a second
                        would require a 1.8 kg flywheel spinning at over 5100 RPM. <br>It was precise. It was powerful.
                    </p>
                    <p>And it was impractical. The weight and energy demands were too steep for a system meant to fly
                        fast and light. So we pivoted to something leaner, more agile.</p>

                <div class="p-col">
                    <p>The canard system uses a compact triple bevel gear transmission, driven by a single central servo
                        to actuate all four blades symmetrically. But bevel gears come with an unavoidable downside:
                        backlash — tiny gaps between gear teeth. At supersonic speeds, this free play becomes a liability.
                        Control-surface flutter can develop, and if oscillations grow beyond the backlash region, vibrations
                        could propagate into the geartrain and surrounding components, risking structural damage.</p>
                    <p>To understand this risk, I developed a time-marching simulation to model the system’s vibrational
                        behavior throughout the rocket’s flight. The key variable was the pivot point of the canard
                        blade. When aligned with both the blade’s center of pressure and center of mass, the blade
                        becomes both statically and dynamically balanced. In this configuration, oscillations are
                        self-limiting — flutter may occur, but it never grows beyond the mechanical slack of the system. But achieving this balance demands complex mass-tuning—fine counterweights, reshaped internals—adding fragility we couldn’t afford.
                    <p>Instead, we went with a practical fix: damping. High-viscosity automotive grease filled the gear gaps and resisted rapid motion, cutting oscillations at the source. </p>

            <div class="row">
                <p>To determine the degree of actuation needed for the canard blade, I developed a set of analytical
                    calculation sheet to determine the amount of roll induced by the canard system. The calculations are
                    based on the aerodynamic forces acting on the canard blades, and the resulting roll moment on the
                    rocket. The calculations take into account the rocket's mass, inertia, and the canard blade's lift
                    coefficient in supersonic and subsonic flight as simulated in ANSYS by Rohan Joshi. The result shows
                    that, to correct a 3Hz roll rate, the canards only need to deflect their angle of attack by ±6
                    degrees. This helps us establish a mechanical hardstop in the system to prevent over-actuation and
                    damaging the canard blades from excessive aerodynamic loading.</p>

                    <p>The final piece of the puzzle in tying the system together was choosing a control method.
                        Writing control code for a rocket is especially challenging—there’s no room for trial
                        and error; it has to work the first time. Fortunately, one tool made this possible:
                        RocketPy, a full 6-DOF rocket flight simulation library written in Python.</p>
                    <p><b>But there was a catch: no one had ever implemented canard-based control in RocketPy
                            before.</b> </p>
                    <p>While the framework supports closed-loop simulations and includes documentation
                        for airbrake systems, nothing existed for more complex aerodynamic surfaces like
                        canards. That meant I had to start from scratch. After a week of digging through the
                        documentation and testing different modules, I managed to piece together a custom
                        framework that allowed me to simulate closed-loop control of canard deployment angles.
                    </p>
                    <p>With the simulation environment in place, the next step was choosing a control algorithm.
                        Since roll control is relatively linear, I started with a simple bang-bang controller.
                        It worked, but the canard movements were overly aggressive and caused significant
                        oscillation. I then tried a high-gain proportional (P-only) controller, which reduced
                        overshoot but introduced steady-state error—and the canards still moved sharply when
                        control kicked in. Next, I experimented with a medium-high P controller and a linear
                        ramp setpoint to gradually decrease roll rate over five seconds before holding it at
                        zero. This smoothed out the response but still left some steady-state error. Finally, I
                        implemented a PI controller with the same ramped setpoint, which eliminated steady-state
                        error and produced much smoother canard movements. This configuration proved to be the
                        most stable and effective and was chosen as the control algorithm for launch.</p>

                    <p>The final step is to tune the system to determine the values of P & I. Due to the inherent high
                        stability of the rocket, tuning methods that use oscillations such as Ziegler Nichols are out of
                        the question, so the parameters had to be manually tuned using a simple setpoint step-response
                        test in the simulation. These chosen parameters are
                        then stress-tested with simulations incorporating environmental factors such as sudden wind
                        gusts and varying degrees of fin misalignment. The values demonstrated good control authority
                        over a large range of conditions and are thus chosen for flight.</p>

                    The IREC 2025 launch was the culmination of our effort. The motor burn was nominal and the rocket demonstrated good off-the-rail stability. However, a structural event as the rocket approached max q led to loss of the fins and causing overall vehicle breakup. The event happened before burnout, so the canards were never actuated, and we unfortunately was not able to observe the canard system in action.

                    Despite this, the launch proved overall aerodynamic stability of the canard, and we recovered all components, with the canard section in surprisingly good shape. Still, the team is incredibly proud of the work that went into this rocket - from design to launch.
